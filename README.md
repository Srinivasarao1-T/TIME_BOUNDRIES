# TIME_BOUND_SECURE_ACCESS_SYSTEM
Here are some relevant GitHub projects related to **time-bound secure access systems**:

---

## 1. âŒ›â€¯**timeSpecificEncryption** 

* Implements **Timeâ€‘Specific Encryption (TSE)** as per Paterson & Quaglia's paper.
* Includes a **Time Server** that periodically broadcasts Time Instant Keys (TIKs), and an **Encryption API** that allows sending messages decryptable only within designated time windows.
* Technically aligned with your concept: it enforces decryption **only if the recipient has the correct TIK** for the time frame you encrypted .

## 2. TBIBS by isecâ€‘tugraz

* Focuses on **time-bound identity-based signatures**, enabling **short-lived forward-secure delegation**, typically for TLS.
* Designed so signatures remain valid only for limited time spans, preventing misuse after expiry.

PROJECT WORK FLOW:
In environments where access must be controlled not only by identity but also by time constraintsâ€”such as laboratories, server rooms, or shift-based workspacesâ€”traditional password-based systems fall short. To address this need, the Time-Bound Secure Access System with Real-Time Temperature Monitoring and User Identification has been developed as a robust embeddedsolution. It combines multi-user authentication via user ID and PIN, real-time access control using an RTC, and continuous environmental temperature monitoring using the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller

Future Enhancement Possibilities:
ïƒ˜ EEPROM storage for non-volatile user credentials and temperature logs
ïƒ˜ UART-based logging of access attempts and temperature data to a PC
ïƒ˜ Threshold-based temperature alerts for safety and automation
