# TIME_BOUND_SECURE_ACCESS_SYSTEM
Here are some relevant GitHub projects related to **time-bound secure access systems**:

## 1. âŒ›â€¯**timeSpecificEncryption** by Aryamanraj

* Implements **Timeâ€‘Specific Encryption (TSE)** as per Paterson & Quaglia's paper.
* Includes a **Time Server** that periodically broadcasts Time Instant Keys (TIKs), and an **Encryption API** that allows sending messages decryptable only within designated time windows.
* Technically aligned with your concept: it enforces decryption **only if the recipient has the correct TIK** for the time frame you encrypted for. ([github.com][1])
  **Repository:** Aryamanraj/timeSpecificEncryption

## 2. TBIBS by isecâ€‘tugraz

* Focuses on **time-bound identity-based signatures**, enabling **short-lived forward-secure delegation**, typically for TLS.
* Designed so signatures remain valid only for limited time spans, preventing misuse after expiry. ([github.com][2])
  **Repository:** isecâ€‘tugraz/TBIBS

### ðŸ”Ž Summary Comparison

| Project                    | Technique                            | Purpose                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **timeSpecificEncryption** | Time-locked encryption (TSE)         | Encrypt messages accessible only at set time intervals   |
| **TBIBS**                  | Time-bound identity-based signatures | Generate signatures valid only for defined short periods |

### âœ… Next Steps: Implementation Tips

* **Choose based on your use case**:

  * Want to **restrict message decryption** in time? â†’ go for **timeSpecificEncryption**.
  * Want **temporary, revocable signature capabilities**? â†’ use **TBIBS**.

* **Setup**:

  * **timeSpecificEncryption**: clone, configure Time Server and Encryption API, generate TIKs ([github.com][2], [github.com][1]).
  * **TBIBS**: follow the repoâ€™s Java or C benchmarks; integrate with your TLS or auth flows ([github.com][2]).

* **Extend or combine**:

  * You could combine both: *encrypt a payload for a time window* with TSE, and *sign it for the same window* using TBIBS.
